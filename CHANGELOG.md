# ChangeLog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

 - "conf" phase instructions: `home`, `act-home`: DIR arg is now relative location of source file
 - `--keep`: Prints sandbox dir in case of error
 - `--act`: Prints output from ATC continuously, and skips phases [before-assert] and [assert]
 - Improves built in help (mostly related to "actor", ""action to check", "including")
