# ChangeLog

## [0.8.9.2] - 2018-06-24

### Changed

 - `[conf]` instructions: `home`, `act-home`: DIR arg is now relative location of source file
 - `--keep`: Prints sandbox dir also in case of error
 - `--act`: Prints output from ATC continuously, and skips phases `[before-assert]` and `[assert]`
 - Improves built in help (mostly related to "actor", ""action to check", "including")
