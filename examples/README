NOTE!
Some test cases may fail because some
external programs used by the examples may not be found on the current OS.
E.g. /usr/bin/python.

The examples need some executable test programs to be generated first.
Generate them using:

>python3 make-executables.py all


Remove them using:

>python3 make-executables.py clean


All examples can be run using:

>exactly suite examples.suite
