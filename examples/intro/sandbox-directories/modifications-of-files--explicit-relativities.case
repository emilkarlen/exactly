#
# Instructions that refer to files have a number of options for specifying the
# location of the file.
#
# This test case tests the same thing as "modifications-of-files.case",
# but uses options to explicitly tell where files are located.
#
#
# Options for sandbox directories:
#
#   "act"    :  "-rel-act" denotes this directory
#
#   "result" : "-rel-result" denotes this directory (but not used in this test)
#
#   "tmp" :   "-rel-tmp" denotes this directory (but not used in this test)
