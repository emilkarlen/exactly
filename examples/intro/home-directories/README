Examples of how the "home directory structure" concept can be used

Exactly has a concept of a "home directory structure".

This is directories that exist before the test case is executed,
and who's contents should not be modified.

The system under test (SUT) is (probably) located here, as well as
resources used by the test case.

There are two home directories:

"act home"  : This is where the [act] phase looks for the program to run
              The "act-home" instruction sets this directory.

"case home" : This is where many instructions looks for files that are used
              by the current test case
              The "home" instruction sets this directory.

By default, both these directories are set to
the directory that contains the test case file.


They can be set by instruction in the "conf" phase:

[conf]

act-home DIR

home     DIR


Instructions can specify paths to be relative one of these using
explicit "relativity":

--rel-act-home PATH

--rel-home     PATH


Predefined symbols and environment variables refer to these directories:
The environment variable and corresponding symbol have the same name:

EXACTLY_ACT_HOME

EXACTLY_HOME


The symbols are of type "path", and may be referenced using either
the --rel option
as in                         --rel EXACTLY_HOME my-file.txt
or the @[symbol_name]@ syntax
as in                         @[EXACTLY_HOME]@/my-file.txt
