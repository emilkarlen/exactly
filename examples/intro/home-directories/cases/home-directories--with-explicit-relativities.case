# Instructions that refer to files have a number of options for specifying the
# location of the file.
#
# This test case tests the same thing as "home-directories.case",
# but uses options to explicitly tell where files are located.
#
#
# Options for home directories:
#
#   "act home"  : "-rel-home-act" denotes this directory (but not used in this test)
#
#   "case home" : "-rel-home" denotes this directory
#

# The "act" phase looks for referenced files in the "act home" directory.
