** Upload your package to PyPI Test

Run:

> python setup.py register -r pypitest

This will attempt to register your package against PyPI's test server, just to
make sure you've set up everything correctly.

Then, run:

> python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest

You should get no errors, and should also now be able to see your library in
the test PyPI repository.

** Upload to PyPI Live

Once you've successfully uploaded to PyPI Test, perform the same steps but
point to the live PyPI server instead. To register, run:

> python setup.py register -r pypi
Then, run:

> python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi
and you're done! Congratulations on successfully publishing your first package!
