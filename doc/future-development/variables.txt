* File inclusion and variable declarations
When a file is included and processed by m4, then the declarations do not
appear in the parsed source, since m4 outputs just space for a declaration.
Thus the only affected output is where the variables are used.

If Exactly has it's own inclusion mechanism, on the other hand, then
declarations will become part of the source.

If declarations become part of the source for phases, then each phase where
they are allowed must be able to parse declarations.

One alternative is to have a file inclusion mechanism that includes only
"definitions", and that is treated as a special kind of information that is
not part of any phase (and thus is parsed by a separate parser.)

Note: since it should not be forced to put declarations in a separate file,
the ordinary phases must be able to handle declarations as well.

* Mixfix syntax for function names

Postfix syntax for argument can make function calls unnatural to read:
----------------------------------------
dir_contains_n_files('my-dir', 5)
----------------------------------------

A mixfix syntax could be easier:

----------------------------------------
dir('my-dir')contains(5)files
----------------------------------------

The name in the symbol table for that function could be
"dir()contains()files"

Each parenthasis should be able to take more than one parameter.

Positive is that this syntax is compatible with normal syntax, if people find
it difficult to learn/use/understand/remember.
