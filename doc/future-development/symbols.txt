* Look at how symbols are defined, todays solution might not be the best
<2017-05-10 ons>
Today, symbols are defined by instructions in two places:
 - symbol_usages
 - main

symbol_usages "report" symbol definitions and references.
This information is sufficent (for today's func) to handle everything related
to symbols.  But that information is not used for sym def.  Instead, the main
method must define a symbol by putting it in the symbol table.
Aspects:
** Ability to assign "dynamic" values / "computed" values
Currently, all values are hard coded constants.
Because of this, they are known at validation-time, and can thus be used in
validation.  Because of this it is possible to check values as part of
validation.

The drawback is that symbols cannot have values that depend on the
main-execution of a test case.  E.g., it is impossible to have a value that is
the content/file-name that has been construted by the sut.
It would be very nice to have this ability.

Two possible solutions are:
*** Separate syntax and set of symbols for dynamic values
**** Separate method for defining a dyn symbol
**** Separate syntax for referencing a dyn symbol
**** Separate symbol tables
*** Separate handling
**** definition
Dynamic symbols would be reqognized by how they were defined - i.e. which
instruction defines them.
They are put in the sym-tbl b
**** instruction reporting of symbol references
A dynamic symbol would be "reported" `symbol_usages` (as constant symbols
are), but the reporting would not contain the value.
**** usage in instruction validation
A dynamic symbol can only be checked for existence - it would be an error if
an instruction references a dynamic symbol that is not defined by an
instruction that precedes the validated instruction.
It would be an implementation error if an instruction tries to use the value
of a dynamic symbol for validation.

This requires two different symbol tables
 - one for validation that that does not contain values for dyn-syms
 - one for main execution that does contain values for all symbols

** Prevent impl-error by preventing accidental access to symbl
An instruction that does not declare a reference to a symbol (via
`symbol_usages`) should not be able to use that symbol.  It would be good if
an implementation error would be reported if an instruction tries to do this -
i.e. the symbol table is populated incrementaly during execution (as opposed
to populating it with all symbols before execution of instruction.main).

This is possible today, by letting the infrastructure populate the sym-tbl
instead of the instructions. As part of executing the main method of an
instruction, the infrastructure would populate the sym-tbl with sym-defs
declared by the instruction (via its `symbol_usages`).
* Syntax for sym-references
<2017-05-10 ons>
Now: @[SYMBOL_NAME]@

Maybe it would be better to have just: SYMBOL_NAME

I believe it is possible to avoid name clashes by just chosing a symbol name
that is not used elswhere in the test case.

This would also avoid clashes with the special character sequences @[, ]@
* File inclusion and variable declarations

When a file is included and processed by m4, then the declarations do not
appear in the parsed source, since m4 outputs just space for a declaration.
Thus the only affected output is where the variables are used.

If Exactly has it's own inclusion mechanism, on the other hand, then
declarations will become part of the source.

If declarations become part of the source for phases, then each phase where
they are allowed must be able to parse declarations.

One alternative is to have a file inclusion mechanism that includes only
"definitions", and that is treated as a special kind of information that is
not part of any phase (and thus is parsed by a separate parser.)

Note: since it should not be forced to put declarations in a separate file,
the ordinary phases must be able to handle declarations as well.

* Mixfix syntax for function names

Postfix syntax for argument can make function calls unnatural to read:
----------------------------------------
dir_contains_n_files('my-dir', 5)
----------------------------------------

A mixfix syntax could be easier:

----------------------------------------
dir('my-dir')contains(5)files
----------------------------------------

The name in the symbol table for that function could be
"dir()contains()files"

Each parenthasis should be able to take more than one parameter.

Positive is that this syntax is compatible with normal syntax, if people find
it difficult to learn/use/understand/remember.
