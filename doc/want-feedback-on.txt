* Exit codes and exit identifiers


Are there better exit codes?

Are the "exit identifiers" a good thing, or are they clumsy?
Are there better exit identifiers?


* Instruction names

A goal is to have "declarative" names.

Does it work?


Assertions are designed to have the form
ACTUAL EXPECTED

E.g.

exitcode 0
stdout empty
type my-file.txt regular


Is this a good choice?
Usually the form "EXPECTED ACTUAL" is better (in my opinion),
but this works not well since the instruction name as the beginning
of the line takes the role of ACTUAL.
